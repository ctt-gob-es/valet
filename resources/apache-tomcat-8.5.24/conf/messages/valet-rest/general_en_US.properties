REST004 = The revocation information can not be returned if it has not been indicated that the revocation status of the certificate should be verified or it has been sended revocation evidences to analyze.
REST005 = Only the country/region of the TSL or its location can be indicated, but not both simultaneously.
REST006 = The validation date [{0}] is not valid because is after the actual date [{1}] (a timegap of [{2}] miliseconds is considered).
REST007 = The requested TSL has not been finded.
REST008 = The information about the requested TSL has been obtained.
REST009 = There was a controlled error while executing the service [{0}]. For more information must check the server log.
REST010 = There was a controlled error while executing the service [{0}], so it is not going to complete the execution and it is going to return that was not possible its execution.
REST011 = There was a non controlled error while executing the service [{0}].
REST012 = There was an error parsing the input X.509 certificate. It must be indicated in Base64.
REST013 = There was no TSL for the country/region [{0}].
REST014 = There was no TSL associated with the location [{0}].
REST015 = There is a TSL for the country/region [{0}] and date [{1}]. The analysis has been fullfilled.
REST016 = There is a TSL for the location [{0}] and date [{1}]. The analysis has been fullfilled.
REST017 = The X.509 certificate has not been detected in the TSL.
REST018 = The X.509 certificate has been detected in the TSL.
REST019 = The X.509 certificate has been detected in the TSL. The requested info mappings has NOT been obtained.
REST020 = The X.509 certificate has been detected in the TSL. The requested info mappings has been obtained.
REST021 = It was not possible to determine the revocation status of the X.509 certificate.
REST022 = The revocation status of the X.509 certificate has been checked: OK.
REST023 = The revocation status of the X.509 certificate has been checked: Revoked.
REST024 = The revocation status of the X.509 certificate has been checked: Expired: The certificate chain is not valid (the validity period has been expired).
REST025 = The revocation status of the X.509 certificate has been checked: Revoked: The TSP-Service that recognize the certificate is revoked.
REST026 = The revocation status of the X.509 certificate has been checked: Unknown: The TSP-Service that recognize the certificate has supervision ceased status.
REST027 = The X.509 certificate has been detected in the TSL. The requested revocation status has NOT been obtained.
REST028 = The X.509 certificate has been detected in the TSL. The requested revocation status has been obtained.
REST029 = The X.509 certificate has been detected in the TSL. The requested info mappings has NOT been obtained. The requested revocation status has NOT been obtained.
REST030 = The X.509 certificate has been detected in the TSL. The requested info mappings has NOT been obtained. The requested revocation status has been obtained.
REST031 = The X.509 certificate has been detected in the TSL. The requested info mappings has been obtained. The requested revocation status has NOT been obtained.
REST032 = The X.509 certificate has been detected in the TSL. The requested info mappings has been obtained. The requested revocation status has been obtained.
REST033 = The validation date [{0}] is not valid because it does not match with the format [{1}].
REST034 = At least one of the CRLs received is not parseable.
REST035 = At least one of the Basic OCSP responses received is not parseable.
REST036 = There was an error trying to get the application [{0}] from the configuration cache.
REST037 = The application [{0}] is not recognized so it is not authorized.
REST038 = There was an error computing the byte array that represents the service response, so it is not going to be added the close transaction message in audit.
REST039 = There was an error computing the byte array that represents the set of input parameters from the service request.
